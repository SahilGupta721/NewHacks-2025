You are an expert UX/UI designer creating the visual identity for a web and mobile app called CulturaCart, a travel-tech and fintech platform that helps tourists shop authentically from local artisans around the world.
Design style should evoke warmth, wanderlust, and cultural storytelling, blending modern minimalism with handcrafted charm.
Theme: Travel × Culture × Authentic Shopping
Moodboard keywords: earthy tones, global traveler, handmade textures, market vibe, cultural discovery, modern nomad, editorial minimalism
Color palette: terracotta (#C97C5D), sand beige (#F2E8D5), olive green (#758467), ocean blue (#4A6FA5), gold accent (#E0AA3E), off-white background (#FAF9F6).
Typography:
Headings — elegant serif (Playfair Display / Cormorant Garamond) for a cultural, magazine feel.
Body — modern sans-serif (Inter / Poppins / Nunito Sans) for clarity and readability.
Design philosophy:
“Authentic Wanderlust”: every screen should feel like a journey through culture and craftsmanship.
Mix warm light, organic materials, and minimalist layouts.
Prioritize storytelling — make each product feel like it has a soul and history.
Interface concepts:
Onboarding: fade-in scenes of local markets, maps, and crafts; CTA “Discover Authentic Crafts in [City].”
Marketplace: grid of artisan items with photos, authenticity score, and story button; large imagery and soft shadows.
Story page: scroll-based storytelling — photos, artisan quote, and map view; combine text and visuals like a travel magazine.
Chatbot: travel assistant UI; warm tone bubbles, suggestions like “Offer $22 politely 😉”.
Gamification: badges like passport stamps — each inspired by national symbols (e.g., lantern, maple leaf, kimono fan).
Imagery:
Real-world photography: artisans at work, cultural textures, markets at golden hour.
Light overlay textures (paper, linen, fabric) to evoke tactility.
Use natural shadows and soft gradients for depth.
Overall aesthetic:
Feels like a mix between Airbnb, Etsy, and National Geographic.
Modern, global, human-centered, and emotionally immersive.
Every visual should whisper “travel with purpose.”
